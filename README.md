# CSX JavaScript Curriculum
### <em>Working through the [CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/home) curriculum</em>

About CSX: CSX takes you under-the-hood of JavaScript from beginner to advanced concepts
Goals:
- Understand JavaScript and coding in a deeper way - the runtime, execution contexts, closures, higher order functions, the call stack and more
- Become autonomous problem solvers not just tutorial followers
- Become sophisticated communicators of our code through pair-programming. We will learn to code as part of a team

### Functions and Execution Context (completed)
Goals: 
- build a strong foundation in the principles of programming in JavaScript - code execution, memory (variable environment), execution context and the call stack
- diagram through these foundations to give ourselves a foundation from which to tackle even the most complex feature of JavaScript in later units.

#### Functions and Execution Context Challenges
- [x] add2
- [x] addS
- [x] Passing Arguments
- [x] Invoking Functions
- [x] getRemainder
- [x] lastLetter
- [x] gradeCalculator
- [x] wereAwesome
- [x] disemvowel
- [x] arrayBuilder

### Closure, Scope & Execution Context (wip)
Goals: 
- understand closure â€“ probably the most misunderstood feature of JavaScript yet one of the most powerful
- understand classic closure functions like once, memoize and even password-protected functions.
  
#### Closure, Scope & Execution Context Challenges 
- [x] addByX
- [x] once
- [x] after
- [x] delay
- [x] saveOutput
- [ ] cycleIterator
- [ ] defineFirstArg
